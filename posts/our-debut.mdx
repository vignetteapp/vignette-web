Hello! Nitrous here. Checking in as one of the project leads and main developers for Vignette. It has been an entire years' worth of work with so much iterations that have gone through and much ideas that come and go.

Honestly it has been a rough ride. But I'm not here to tell you my life's story. Today, we're going to showcase Vignette Debut.

## Debut
Let's not beat around the bush. Want to try it out now? Vignette Debut is available for everyone for free over at [GitHub](https://github.com/vignetteapp/vignette/releases).

If you've been sticking with us throughout the entire project, you may have noticed that there's features that didn't make the cut and the build is rather basic. It has been a decision for us to move on with [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework), the underlying game framework used to build this version. Alongside it was to simply remove features we deemed not necessary for a technical preview as it added more technical debt and was simply not the main focus of the application.

This decision was rather hard to swallow. Although, worry not as we are not losing much effort done given how we structured the project. For more details regarding this decision, you can read more about it in this [article](https://github.com/vignetteapp/vignette/discussions/233) over at GitHub.

## FAQ
#### 1. Why can't I change my avatar and/or background?
- We are only allowing a specific avatar and background for this technical demo. Please stand by for encore for the full experience!
#### 2. Will you support X distro for Linux?
- We don't really have an official version for Linux. However, we do have appointed community members to maintain releases for it in other Linux distributions. If you are interested in making releases for your distro, please join our [Discord](https://go.vignetteapp.org/discord) and we'll get you up to speed.
#### 3. Why is it so bare bones?
- Please understand that the highlight of the Debut milestone is the tracking technology - meaning we only focus on the face tracking, not to mention we also took this opportunity to get the correct user experience in our interfaces as the previous public builds tested the basic functionality already. They are all going to culminate in the stable version, which is Encore. Sorry if you expect these features you saw in the development previews to exist in Debut!
#### 4. Encore this, Encore that, can't you just fix it?
- We would love to, but if you read our [previous blogs before](https://github.com/vignetteapp/vignette/discussions/233), we have attempted countless of times but at the expense of us doing very bad practices in coding which backfired a lot especially now in Debut. Encore will allow us to start anew, now that we have the building blocks in place, and implement them in a way that all of us will be satisified.

*Note: This FAQ may be expanded post-publishing as we get to answer more questions from the community. We'll leave a note when this was last updated!*

### Known Issues
- Memory leak when switching from a disabled camera to a good camera.

- Model eyes (or any drawables that are drawn inside clipping masks) sometime disappear.

## Encore
The next phase of this project is dubbed "Encore". Everything will be done under a new game engine under [Stride](https://stride3d.net) and our focus is to make Vignette an extendable application allowing community-made modules.

Our next step is to expand our reach to more storefronts. Such as [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) and the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows) with a fixed price. This includes the core application and the Live2D module.

### Wait, why is Vignette on storefronts paid?
We've tried to make it free; we really did. However, due to Live2D's strict requirements to have a revenue model, it was decided upon that we will ship the storefront versions paid with the Live2D feature prepackaged. Another reason is because the project will become too unsustainable if we provide almost everything. Hence, with a heavy heart, we have decided that our storefront versions are paid.

Fret not, however as we're not commercializing the product. For full transparency, the funds you will pay Vignette on the storefront versions will be split accordingly as follows:

- 20% of what you pay goes towards Live2D for licensing compliance
- 10% goes to the [Open Source Collective](https://oscollective.org), which is handling the organization's funds.
- 10% goes to [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org), to further their mission in providing services to the entire free and open-source community.
- What's left will be used to pay our developers and every contributor who has tirelessly worked on Vignette to bring you the best experience possible.

    We will still provide releases over at GitHub for free without the Live2D module. 
    
    We made this decision to reach a wider audience to support both tech-savvy individuals and content creators alike.

*Note: Linux releases will be based on the GitHub release.*
